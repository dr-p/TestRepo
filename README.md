VERY IMPORTANT READ TWICE
If Android Studio asks if you want to add a .idea\vcs.xml file to git while working on the project at anytime
select "no" and "do not ask again." .idea\vcs.xml files are IDE dependent and adding them to git may cause conflicts for others.


Make sure your Android Studio environment is set up with everything updated in the SDK manager. Check these three links
below to see the exact environment config used to set up the project. If you are unable to open the project properly after cloning and following the steps below, make sure your IDE and JDK are both up to date. Also make sure you have Android version 4.4.2 API 19 loaded.

TO BEGIN COLLABORATING AND MAKING CHANGES TO THIS PROJECT:
1. Download Git from https://git-scm.com/
2. Open Android Studio
3. Check out project from Version Control
4. Select Github
5. Enter https://github.com/dr-p/testRepo.git for the "Git Repository URL"
6. Choose a parent directory for the cloned project (Preferably a separate folder from your main AndroidStudio project
directory folder such as AndroidStudioGithub for example)
7. Clone and open project
8. If it throws errors of "cannot load modules" Link for image of missing modules error:  https://www.dropbox.com/s/6v6joohbib386pj/Error%20cannot%20load%20modules.png?dl=0
9. If you see a message stating "Unregistered VCS root" click add on the pop up or if it vanishes to quickly, open the event
   log in the bottom right corner to add the root.
10. In your left project window view, the app files should now be available.
11. IF ANDROID STUDIO ASKS IF YOU WANT TO ADD A .IDEA\VCS.XML FILE TO GIT WHILE WORKING ON THE PROJECT
SELECT NO AND TO NOT ASK AGAIN. .IDEA\VCS.XML FILES ARE IDE DEPENDENT AND ADDING THEM TO GITHUB WILL CAUSE FILE CONFLICTS.
